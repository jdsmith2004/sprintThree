# Overview

This is a sql program written in python that allows the user to make edits to a database of employees. Features include adding, viewing, editing, and removing employees. I build this as a self introduction to SQL and as an oppurtunity to grow my knowledge and ability as a programmer.

This was written to eventually be modified and added to a future website.
